# Icaria Sailing Barcelona
Website for sailing charter in balearic islands back in 2014.
Icaria is the name of a sailing boat that belongs to 'la base n√†utica' which is a sailing club in Barcelona. They run 1week/10 days charters to Balearic islands, Corsica and Sicilia depending on the year.
Their bussines idea is focused on learning to sail while having fun and meeting new people in a regatta sailing boat that sailed the globe back in 1982.
My job was to desing a nice beautiful website that would catch the adventurer spirit of the club and also display all the information about the charters in a very clear way.
They loved it!
